I am currently serving as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Kansas, but I am based at CERN in Geneva (CH) to coordinate the test activities of my experiment.</p> <p>I am deeply involved in the FoCal experiment, a forward calorimeter designed for the upgrade of the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this role, I serve as the Test Beam Coordinator and am responsible for overseeing the FoCal laboratory. I also contribute to detector Research and Development (R&amp;D) efforts for calorimetry and fast timing for the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), as well as several spin-off projects.  </p> <p>Recently, I led the operation of the EMCal detector of ALICE, holding the position of Technical Coordinator and System Run Coordinator during the LHC 2025 proton-proton campaign, as well as the scheduled special runs (Oxygen-proton, Oxygen-Oxygen, Neon-Neon).  </p> <p>Previously, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Kansas under the supervision of Professor Christophe Royon. My doctoral studies were centered on particle physics, with a focus on the design, testing, and characterization of particle detectors for High Energy Physics experiments. My expertise spans various detector types, including timing, solid-state, and gas detectors.  </p> <p>During my Ph.D., I contributed to two particle physics collaborations: the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and the TOTEM/PPS collaborations. My thesis topics also included additional detector R&amp;D projects, such as the design of a NASA cubesat detector for particle identification and the employment of fast Si detectors for single particle identification in high-rate medical facilities.</p>"},{"location":"cv/","title":"Tommaso Isidori","text":"<p>Experimental Physicist &amp; Data Acquisition Engineer.</p> <ul> <li>Download CV{:target=\"_blank\"}</li> <li>Publications</li> </ul>"},{"location":"publications/","title":"Publications","text":"<p>This page auto-lists publications from the BibTeX file.</p> <p>{::bibtex}</p>"}]}
